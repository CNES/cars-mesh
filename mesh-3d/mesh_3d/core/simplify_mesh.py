    Function to simplify mesh using Quadric Error Metric Decimation by Garland and Heckbert

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh: Mesh

    target_number_of_triangles: int
        The number of triangles that the simplified mesh should have. It is not guaranteed that this number will be reached.

        The maximum error where a vertex is allowed to be merged

        A weight applied to edge vertices used to preserve boundaries
