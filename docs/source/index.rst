CARS-MESH, 3D surface reconstruction
====================================

CARS-MESH is a library to do 3D Surface reconstruction with texture and classification from remote sensing photogrammetric point cloud.

This tool is part of 3D CNES satellite tools around `CARS <https://github.com/cnes/cars>`_  but can be run independently. CARS can be used to generate input point clouds from stereo images.

This library was created during a CNES R&T (Research & Technology) project.
